# Linked-List-Projects

Mini project implementing linked lists.
This is an implementation of a linked list used as a name directory. The user can add a name, remove a name, and view all names in the list. 

Feel free to reference this code for help with creating a linked list, adding to a linked list, removing from a linked list given a node value (without knowing the position), and printing a linked list.
